# Multilevel Monte Carlo Simulation Path

This project focuses on the implementation and testing of **multi-level Monte Carlo (MLMC)** methods and **finite difference methods (FDM)** for numerical simulations in finance.

## Requirements

To run the code and notebooks in this repository, you will need **Python** and the following standard packages:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`

Ensure you have `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `scipy` installed in your Python environment before running the scripts or notebooks:

```sh
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```

## Repository Structure

- **`src/`**:
    Contains the core implementation files:

- **`notebooks/`**:
    Includes Jupyter notebooks used for testing, validation, and analysis:

- **`report.pdf`**:
    The final report, located at the root of the repository, provides implementation details, and results.
